The Django project focuses on scraping data from the Jumia Tunisia website within the phones category. This project aims to retrieve relevant information about various phone products listed on the Jumia Tunisia platform.

By leveraging web scraping techniques, the project collects data such as product names, prices, descriptions, and other details related to phones available for sale on Jumia Tunisia. This data can be used for various purposes, including price comparison, market analysis, or building a product catalog.

The project utilizes the Django framework, a powerful Python web development framework, to structure and manage the application. Django provides a convenient and efficient way to handle URL routing, database management, and rendering HTML templates.
